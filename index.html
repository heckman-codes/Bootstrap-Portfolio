                <hr>
                <p>My name is Liam Heckman. I was born in Hawaii and moved to California at a young age. But I have
                    lived by the coast almost my whole life. After I graduated high school, I moved to Sacramento to go
                    to school at California State University Sacramento. Initially I enrolled as a physics major but
                    changed to Graphic Design. In December of 2017, I graduated with my Bachelors and began to look for
                    work. For the past three years, I have worked in design doing advertisements and animations for
                    clients in the produce, deli, and real estate industries.</p>
                <p>I love rock climbing. In 2012 I was introduced to in when I first moved into the dorms and wanted to
                    make friends. Since then, I climb in the gym three times a week and outside at least once a week.
                    Sticking to mostly day trips I boulder, which is shorter, difficult climbs. But I have a few notable
                    ascents of mountains like Half Dome in Yosemite, CA, and Tenaya Peak in Tuolumne, CA.</p>
